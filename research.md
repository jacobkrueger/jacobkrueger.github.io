### Research

In my research, I focus on understanding, describing, and facilitating software evolution and the impact of human factors, particularly developers cognition, by integrating psychological and economical concepts. Roughly, my research can be structured in five intersecting sub-topics, yielding empirical insights, novel techniques, formal models, and guidelines for conducting such types of research.

The primary focus of my dissertation has been on the re-engineering of variant-rich-systems. A variant-rich system describes a number of reused software variants that are similar, but have unique functionalities (i.e., features) to fulfill individual customer requirements. Organizations implement variant-rich systems through different techniques, which can be primarily distinguished into clone-based (e.g., copy-paste, clone & own) or platform-based (e.g., product-line engineering) strategies. Most developers start with clone-based development by creating and adapting a copy of an existing variant, since it is well supported and readily available, for instance, via forking on GitHub. However, an increasing number of cloned variants can easily cause problems in developing and maintaining the variant-rich system, for instance, because new features or bug fixes must be propagated between the independent and co-evolving variants. In such cases, organizations often decide to adopt a platform by re-engineering their cloned variants. A platform builds on a variability mechanism (i.e., a technique for implementing configuration options, such as the C preprocessor) and automated tool support (e.g., for modeling features, configuring, and deriving variants) to help developers reuse software artifacts more systematically.
