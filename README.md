I am a software-engineering researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, specializing on how developers evolve software systems. Focus points of my research are (1) variant-rich systems, which exist in different customizable variants and have become the most widely existing form of software systems in all areas of society; and (2) studying human factors (e.g., program comprehension, forgetting) in software evolution and their interplay with quality through empirical research. My goal as a researcher is to improve our foundational understanding of how software evolves, focusing on the interplay of human cognition and software quality. 

Evolving variant-rich systems is particularly challenging for developers and has been the focus of my PhD, which I obtained in 2021 from the [Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Leich](https://www.hs-harz.de/tleich/zur-person/) and [Prof. Gunter Saake](https://www.dbse.ovgu.de/dbse/en/Staff/Gunter+Saake.html). My [dissertation](https://opendata.uni-halle.de//handle/1981185920/41305) (external reviewers: [Prof. Jan Bosch](https://janbosch.com/) and [Prof. Rick Rabiser](https://rickrabiser.github.io/rick/)) focused on providing an empirics-based understanding of the re-engineering of variant-rich systems to support developers in the decision whether to rely on unsystematic or systematic software reuse. During these studies, I found that developers' comprehension of their system is the most important factor to engineer high-quality (variant-rich) software. This topic has fascinated me ever since.
