I am a software engineering researcher with a focus on human aspects in software evolution, integrating economics, psychology, and other domains into software engineering. Currently, I work as an Academic Council (PostDoc position) at the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.

In 2021, I obtained my PhD from the [Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Leich](https://www.hs-harz.de/tleich/zur-person/) and [Prof. Gunter Saake](https://www.dbse.ovgu.de/en/Staff/Gunter+Saake.html). My [dissertation](https://opendata.uni-halle.de//handle/1981185920/41305) (external reviewers: [Prof. Jan Bosch](https://janbosch.com/) and [Prof. Rick Rabiser](https://rickrabiser.github.io/rick/)) focused on providing an empirics-based understanding of the re-engineering of variant-rich systems to support developers in the decision whether to rely on unsystematic or systematic software reuse. For this purpose, I studied modern practices of engineering variant-rich systems to derive a novel process model as well as guidelines for scoping and planning the (re-)engineering of variant-rich systems. Digging into the details of such re-engineering endeavors, I elicited insights into the economics of software reuse, the impact of missing knowledge, and how to improve the tracing of that knowledge. Building on my dissertation, I am advancing with a focus on developers’ cognition and the challenges therein that are related to software evolution.

If you are interested in collaborating with me (e.g., theses, research/industrial projects), just send me an email! Particularly for students, I can offer the following topics and their intersections (these are only examples, feel free to suggest your own!):

- Re-engineering variant-rich systems
   - Economic impact of re-engineering
   - Challenges of merging variants
- Quality problems in software evolution
   - Degeneration of software architecture
   - Code and bug propagation
- Cognitive problems in software evolution
   - Cognitive biases
   - Program comprehension
- Fork-based software development
   - Developer support for merging forks
   - Knowledge recovery
- Guidelines for conducting research 
   - Management of research artifacts
   - Empirical studies
